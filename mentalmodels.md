2. **Implement Logic:** Add to `src/panda_mcp/core/planning/mental_models.py`
3. **Create Templates:** Add planning step templates
4. **Add Tests:** Create validation tests
5. **Update Documentation:** Add to this file with [x] status

### Usage in Planning

Mental models can be specified in planning requests:
```python
context = {
    "mental_models": ["first_principles", "systems_thinking"],
    "domain": "software_development"
}
```

### Combining Models

Multiple mental models can be combined for comprehensive analysis:
