**Batch 6 - Sustainability Patterns (4 patterns):** Contract Management, Environmental Impact, Waste Management, Social Responsibility

### Integration Guidelines

#### Adding New Auditing Patterns

1. **Define the Pattern:** Create clear description and use cases
2. **Implement Logic:** Add to `src/panda_mcp/core/auditing/patterns.py`
3. **Create Templates:** Add auditing step templates
4. **Add Tests:** Create validation tests
5. **Update Documentation:** Add to this file with [x] status

#### Usage in Auditing

Auditing patterns can be specified in audit requests:
```python
context = {
    "auditing_patterns": ["vulnerability_assessment", "code_quality"],
    "scope": "application_security"
}
```

#### Combining Patterns

Multiple auditing patterns can be combined for comprehensive assessment:
- **Security + Compliance:** Vulnerability Assessment + Regulatory Compliance
- **Quality + Performance:** Code Quality + System Performance
- **Governance + Risk:** Policy Adherence + Risk Management

#### Framework Extension

The auditing patterns framework is designed to be extensible. New patterns should follow the established pattern of:
1. Clear audit scope definition
2. Structured assessment steps
3. Finding categorization
4. Remediation guidance
5. Compliance validation

### Expected Implementation Outcome

Upon completion, the auditing patterns framework will provide:
- **42 comprehensive auditing patterns** across all major domains
- **Structured 8-10 step processes** for each pattern
- **Clear expected outputs** and deliverables
- **Integration with existing auditing framework**
- **Production-ready implementation** for immediate use

This will complement the mental models framework and provide a complete planning and auditing solution for the PandA MCP Server.
