### ✅ MCP Server Integration Validation

**Test 5: Server Interface Update**
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Evidence**: Successfully updated MCP server with:
  - New `panda_audit` method using cognitive frameworks

  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Documentation for both interfaces

**Test 6: Backward Compatibility**
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Evidence**: Legacy `analyze_content` method maintained with migration guidance

## Cognitive Framework Effectiveness Validation

### Security Audit Framework Example

**Scenario**: Security audit of PandA MCP server
**Framework Applied**: security_audit

**Investigation Questions Provided**:
1. "What are the primary assets and data that need protection?"
2. "What are the potential threat vectors and attack surfaces?"
3. "How are access controls implemented and managed?"
4. "What security controls are currently in place?"
5. "How are security incidents detected and responded to?"

**Methodology Phases**:
- **Planning**: Define scope, identify assets, conduct risk assessment
- **Information Gathering**: Review policies, examine architecture, analyze access controls
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Test controls, assess vulnerabilities, analyze monitoring
- **Analysis and Reporting**: Identify gaps, assess risks, develop recommendations

**Professional Value**: Provides systematic approach following industry standards rather than random pattern detection.

### Compliance Audit Framework Example

**Investigation Questions**:
1. "What regulatory requirements apply to this organization?"
2. "How are compliance requirements documented and communicated?"
3. "What policies and procedures support compliance requirements?"

**Risk Assessment Approach**: "Risk-based approach prioritizing high-impact regulatory requirements, focusing on areas with severe penalties, regulatory scrutiny, or business impact."

## Validation Against Requirements
