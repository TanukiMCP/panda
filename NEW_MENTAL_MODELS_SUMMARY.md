## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Proper Wiring & Integration
âœ… All 22 models follow consistent structure with:
- `description`: Clear purpose and use case
- `questions`: Guided inquiry prompts
- `structure`: Systematic thinking framework
- `next_steps`: Action-oriented guidance

âœ… Fully integrated into PandA system:
- Added to `src/panda_mcp/mental_models/__init__.py` registry
- Dynamic loading through existing plan.py framework
- Available via `panda_plan` MCP tool interface
- Compatible with progressive planning workflows

### Taskmaster MCP Synergy Features
ðŸŽ¯ **Task Management**: Models like `task_decomposition`, `parallel_processing`, and `quality_gates` directly enhance Taskmaster workflow execution

ðŸŽ¯ **Evidence Collection**: Models like `evidence_synthesis` and `feedback_loops` complement Taskmaster's evidence collection capabilities

ðŸŽ¯ **Progressive Planning**: Models like `adaptive_planning` and `minimum_viable_plan` support Taskmaster's iterative execution model

ðŸŽ¯ **Resource Coordination**: Models like `resource_optimization` and `stakeholder_alignment` enhance Taskmaster's capability mapping

## ðŸ§© Usage Examples

### With Taskmaster Workflows
```python
# Example: Using task_decomposition with Taskmaster
panda_plan(
    thought="How should I break down this complex project into manageable tasks?",
    framework="task_decomposition",
    context={"project_scope": "...", "resources": "...", "timeline": "..."}
)

# Example: Using quality_gates for workflow checkpoints  
panda_plan(
    thought="What quality standards should I establish at each project phase?",
    framework="quality_gates",
    context={"deliverables": "...", "stakeholders": "..."}
)
```

### For Advanced LLM Planning
```python
# Example: Using evidence_synthesis for research
panda_plan(
    thought="How do I integrate contradictory research findings?", 
    framework="evidence_synthesis",
    context={"sources": "...", "contradictions": "..."}
)

# Example: Using devils_advocate for critical analysis
panda_plan(
    thought="What could go wrong with this strategy?",
    framework="devils_advocate", 
    context={"strategy": "...", "assumptions": "..."}
)
```
